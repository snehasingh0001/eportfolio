        <p>
            Hi! I’m Sneha Singh, a final-year B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in web development.
            I enjoy creating clean, user-friendly websites and love learning new things that challenge me to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m adaptable, focused, and always open to feedback that helps me improve. Outside of academics, I enjoy listening
            to music and traveling—it helps me stay creative and inspired.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can apply my skills, learn from real-world experiences, and grow both personally and professionally.
