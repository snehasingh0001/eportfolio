        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I’m Sneha Singh, a final-year B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in web development. I enjoy creating clean, user-friendly websites and love learning new things that challenge me to grow.

I’m adaptable, focused, and always open to feedback that helps me improve. Outside of academics, I enjoy listening to music and traveling—it helps me stay creative and inspired.

I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can apply my skills, learn from real-world experiences, and grow both personally and professionally.</p>
